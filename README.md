# Basilic - ETL

## Introduction

Basilic is a sandbox project to learn to cook & code.

It covers the financial, organizational and healthy points to improve cooking.

Today, I save all of this in multiple Notion databases, but I want to take things to the next level: create a shopping cart from recipes selected for the week.
For that I need to be able to formalize the ingredients and recipes from the Notion databases.

The deadline for this project is September 2024

## Plan

1. Take courses on https://www.kaggle.com/ on a daily basis
2. Develop the ETL to fill Basilic's DB with ingredients and recipes
